In 'the set of all the curves in Model 4.ipynb', you can get the results of our suicide model, which includes: 
the normal decline curve with a high number of bacteria, 
the density curve after the normal declination reaches the density threshold after activating the toxin pathway, 
and the density curve when the bacteria spill into the low-density area or the outside world.
